5.5.4    Upon acceptance of the Terms of Service You may obtain one or more license keys by paying the Product license fee indicated in the Product Description. License orders are final, Wikitude does not refund license fees.

5.6.2    Sharing a license key provided to You by Wikitude with any Third Party is strictly prohibited and may lead to Your prosecution for intentional infringement of Wikitude’s rights under civil as well as criminal law.

Third Party Software included in a Product for which You acquired a Commercial License shall never form an obstacle to commercial use of an application You created; You shall read and comply with the terms by the right holder(s) of such Third Party Software. 

5.8.1    The delivery of the Product does not convey a license, nor imply any rights, to use Third Party Software. You acknowledge and hereby accept that in some instances You may be required to obtain a separate license of the right holder(s) prior to using their Software and/or to making available Derivative Works into which their Software has been incorporated. You shall be solely responsible to verify whether You are required to obtain a license. If applicable, You shall be solely responsible to obtain such a license. 


6    PROVISION OF THE WIKITUDE SDK

6.1    You acknowledge and hereby accept that the nature and form of the Wikitude SDK may be subject to temporary and/or permanent changes without prior notice (including but not limited to updates, bug fixes and patches) and that future versions of the Wikitude SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the Wikitude SDK.

7.1    Information You receive in the course of buying and using a Product and its components, in particular the Wikitude SDK, is considered confidential, including, but not limited to, information on content, functionality and range of functions of the Wikitude SDK. You shall treat all such information as confidential and transfer these confidentiality obligations to all Authorized Users. No confidential information may be disclosed to Third Parties without the prior written consent of Wikitude. 

7.2    The foregoing obligation, however, shall not apply to any part of the information that (i) has been disclosed in publicly available sources of information, (ii) is, through none of Your or Your Authorized Users’ fault, hereafter disclosed in publicly available sources of information, (iii) is now in Your possession without any obligation of confidentiality, or (iv) has been or is hereafter rightfully disclosed to You by a Third Party, but only to the extent that the use or disclosure thereof has been or is rightfully authorized by that Third Party. 

8    PRIVACY

8.1    You must comply with all Applicable Laws including all applicable privacy laws; and with Wikitude’s publicly disseminated Privacy Policy; and with all provisions of the „Google Analytics Terms of Service“ at any time. You shall be solely responsible to obtain all necessary consents and approvals of Your End Users. In particular You are responsible to provide End Users with all information required and to obtain all required consents in the required form under Applicable Law.

8.2    If Your Derivative Work is an application that collects, uses, processes, transmits and/or discloses End User Data, You represent and warrant that You will have obtained all necessary consents from the End user to the collection, use, processing, transmission and/or disclosure of such information. In addition, the use of location data should be limited solely as necessary to provide services or functionality for Your application (e.g., the use of collected personal information for marketing purposes is prohibited, unless permitted under Applicable Law and expressly consented to by the End User). If Your Derivative Work stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely.

8.3    Wikitude does not track individual usage of the applications (Derivative Works) You created unless the following constitutes such tracking under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdictions in which Your Derivative Works are made available to End Users. You acknowledge and hereby agree that Wikitude may anonymously track and report the distribution of Your Derivative Works through use of information set out in section 5.6.1. You must indicate to Your End Users, either in the app itself or in Your terms of service, that the distribution of Your application may be anonymously tracked and reported and You must provide such information to the users. If required by Applicable Law, You must obtain the End User’s consent hereto.

8.4    In particular if You intend to distribute or make available within the European Union Derivative Works that gain access to any other information stored in the mobile device of the End User than information technically required for the purpose of enabling You to provide a service requested by the End-User, You undertake to get the End User’s consent based on the required comprehensive information, including but not limited to the type of collected information, the purposes for which such information is being collected, the way it is being used and, if applicable the Third Parties to which such information will be transmitted. The aforesaid is applicable to any information irrespective of such information qualifying as “personal data” or not. You are aware that under the EU privacy regime You need to meet in particular the following requirements:

(a)    Ask for consent before the app starts to retrieve or place information on the device, i.e., before installation of the app. Such consent has to be freely given, specific and informed; \
(b)    ask for granular consent for each type of data the app will access; at least, if accessed, for the following categories: Location, Contacts, Unique Device Identifier, Identity of the data subject, Identity of the phone, Credit card and payment data, Telephony and SMS, Browsing history, Email, Social networks credentials and Biometrics;\
(c)    be aware that consent does not legitimize excessive or disproportionate data processing; \
(d)    provide well-defined and comprehensible purposes of the data processing in advance to installation of the app, and not change these purposes without renewed consent; \
(e)    provide comprehensive information if the data will be used for third party purposes, such as advertising or analytics; \
(f)    allow users to revoke their consent and uninstall the app, and delete data where appropriate; \
(g)    respect the principle of data minimization and only collect those data that are strictly necessary to perform the desired functionality; take the necessary organizational and technical measures to ensure the protection of the personal data You process, at all stages of the design and implementation of the application (privacy by design); \
(h)    provide a single point of contact for the users of the application. Provide a readable, understandable and easily accessible privacy policy that in particular fulfils the information duties set out in Art. 12 to 14 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);\
(i)    enable app users to exercise their rights as a data subject as defined in the Art. 15 et seq of the GDPR (in particular, access, rectification, erasure and their right to object to data processing) and inform them about the existence of these mechanisms;\
(j)    define a reasonable retention period for data collected with the app and predefine a period of inactivity after which the account will be treated as expired; \
(k)    with regard to apps aimed at children: pay attention to the age limit defining children or minors in Art. 8 GDPR and in national legislation, choose the most restrictive data processing approach in full respect of the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, refrain from processing children&#39;s data for behavioural advertising purposes, either directly or indirectly and refrain from collecting data through the children about their relatives and/or friends.

8.5    If any consent from the End User to the collection, use, processing, transmission and/or disclosure of such End User Data is denied or withdrawn, You may not collect, use, process, transmit and/or disclose the End User Data or perform any other actions for which the End Users consent has been denied or withdrawn.

13.2    Licenses granted to You by Wikitude free of charge shall remain in full force and effect for the period of time indicated in the Product Description unless terminated earlier by either party. Termination is possible for either party at any time.
